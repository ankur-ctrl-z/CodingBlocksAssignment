# Coding Blocks DSA Assignments 💻📚

Welcome to my repository for **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** assignments given by **Coding Blocks**! 🎓 This repository contains solutions to various DSA problems, organized by topic, which I completed as part of my learning journey. The purpose of this repository is to track my progress, practice problem-solving, and enhance my understanding of DSA concepts. 🚀

## 📂 Repository Structure

The code is organized into different folders based on the topic. Each folder contains individual problem solutions, along with brief comments explaining the approach and logic used to solve the problem.

- **Arrays**
- **Linked Lists**
- **Stacks & Queues**
- **Trees**
- **Searching & Sorting**
- **Recursion**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Graphs**
- **Greedy Algorithms**
- **Bit Manipulation**
- **Backtracking**

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java** - For solving problems (since Coding Blocks uses Java for DSA assignments)
- **Data Structures** - Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Stacks, Queues, etc.
- **Algorithms** - Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming, Backtracking, etc.

## 💡 How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ankur1435/CodingBlocksAssignment.git
2. Navigate to the respective folder and open the Java files to view the solution.
3. Feel free to explore, contribute, or suggest improvements to the solutions. 

## 📈 Progress

This repository is a continuous learning project. As I work through more problems, I will keep adding new solutions here. Stay tuned for updates! 🔥
